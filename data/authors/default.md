### <a id="interests"></a>Interests

- Things that could exist but don't yet
- Natural Language Processing (treating words as data with a computer program )
- Open source geospatial tools
- Sharing at Scale:
  - This includes questions like open data interface design; code citation tooling as a way to change its perceived value; group membership and behaviors in open source that impact how science gets done; different incentives between inner source and open source; platform and tooling effects on code sharing; and code dependencies as reusable metadata and a metaphor for developer skills.
