# Introduction

In the pursuit of leveraging space technology for sustainable development in Africa, this concept note explores specific and innovative use cases that align with ongoing international new space entrepreneurship initiatives, focusing on practical implementations that address pressing societal issues and foster sustained commercial growth.

## Hackathons & Mentoring

The space tech and space-enabled hackathons present an opportunity to drive practical implementations of space data in Africa. By organizing region-specific hackathons, technology enthusiasts, innovators, and entrepreneurs can develop digital applications leveraging satellite data to address distinct African challenges. For example, collaborative efforts could be directed towards the development of AI-driven solutions that utilize satellite imagery and positioning services to enhance precision agriculture practices, monitor natural resources, or support disaster management efforts in the continent's diverse landscapes.

## Matchmaking

The concept of matchmaking events adopted from international new space entrepreneurship initiatives can be tailored to facilitate networking opportunities among African startups and SMEs, fostering collaborations and partnerships to drive innovative applications of space data. By leveraging the matchmaking model, African entrepreneurs can establish connections with potential product development partners, customers, and investors to realize the full potential of space-enabled solutions. For example, these connections could lead to the development of precision forestry and biodiversity conservation initiatives using Copernicus satellite data, fostering sustainable resource management across the continent.

## Prizes and Competitions

Drawing inspiration from the space challenges, an adaptation of similar competitions in Africa could encourage innovators to leverage Galileo and Copernicus satellite data to address pressing societal issues unique to the African context. The introduction of regional challenges could promote the development of digital solutions focused on climate change mitigation, precision farming, and community-based health tech practices. Offering substantial prize pools for winning solutions would incentivize the creation of impactful applications that contribute to sustainable development and societal resilience across diverse African communities.

## Access to Finance

The establishment of other space initiatives-inspired finance facility in Africa could enable local space companies to access risk capital, fostering the development and marketing of space technology and digital services utilizing space data. By providing capital to innovative startups and SMEs in the region, this initiative could empower the growth of space applications tailored to address the continent's unique challenges, such as climate resilience, agricultural optimization, and environmental monitoring.

## Business Accelerator

An adaptation of the space ventures acceleration model in Africa can provide top-level business coaching, training, and seed funding to startups and scaleups focusing on upstream and downstream space applications. This initiative could offer strategic support and investment coaching tailored to the local context, fostering sustained commercial growth and impactful implementations of space data across various African industries.

## In conclusion,

The innovative use cases for space data in Africa present a transformative landscape for sustainable development and commercial growth. By adapting best-in-class principles to the African context, these practical implementations aim to harness the full potential of space data to address pressing societal issues, foster innovation, and drive sustainable development across the continent.

This concept note draws inspiration from other ongoing international new space entrepreneurship initiatives and applies it to the African context, outlining practical and innovative use cases for space data tailored to address pressing societal issues and drive sustained commercial growth.
